  "readme": "# Component Search\n\nNext version of Component's [search-api](https://github.com/component/search-api). Instead of having a dedicated search server, a JSON file of [crawled](https://github.com/component/crawler.js) components is used in both the client and server instead. This library is available in both the browser and node.js.\n\nThe search algorithm is currently very rudimentary. Please advise!\n\n## Node API\n\n### var components = yield* search(options)\n\n- `text` <String> - search through the `.name` and `.description` of components for `text`\n- `keywords` <Array> - filter components by each `keyword`\n- `owner` <String> - filter components by a GitHub user or organization\n- `limit` <Integer> - maximum number of results\n\nBy default, components are sorted by stars/watchers, descending.\n\nIf you want to use a callback instead like the browser API, wrap `search` in `co` like: `var search = co(require('component-search2'))`.\n\n## Browser API\n\n### search(options, function (err, components) {})\n\nThe browser API is the same except with a callback instead.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 segmentio &lt;team@segment.io&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
