Stored in a separate repo for standalone usag.\n\nThe purpose of this method is to:\n\n- Flatten the dependency tree into the proper build order. The proper build order is (specifically for CSS):\n  1. Remotes dependencies\n  2. Local dependencies\n  3. Component's files\n- Check for multiple versions of a remote dependency\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar resolver = require('component-resolver');\nvar flatten = require('flatten');\n\nresolver().getTree(function (err, tree) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  var branches = flatten(tree);\n  // do stuff with the branches\n})\n```\n\n### var nodes[] = flatten(tree)\n\n`tree` is the result of `resolver`'s `.tree()` or `.getTree()` methods. Nodes will also be populated with:\n\n- `.duplicates` - an object containing remote dependencies with multiple versions\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
