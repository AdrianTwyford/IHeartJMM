  "readme": "# codeclimate-test-reporter\n\nSupplies a script which accepts lcov data over standard input, formats the coverage data and sends it to Code Climate.\n\nCode Climate - [https://codeclimate.com](https://codeclimate.com)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis npm package requires having a user (but not necessarily a paid account) on Code Climate, so if you don't have one the\nfirst step is to create an account at: [https://codeclimate.com](https://codeclimate.com). Then:\n\n1. Generate coverage data in [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/geninfo.1.php) format\n\n      Lcov data can be generated by a number of JavaScript code coverage tools, including [Istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul).\n\n1. Install codeclimate's NPM package\n\n          $ npm install -g codeclimate-test-reporter\n\n1. Specifying your repo token as an environment variable, send lcov coverage data to the codeclimate npm script.\n\n      For example, if your coverage data resides in a \"lcov.info\" file:\n\n          CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN=ABCD11110000000 codeclimate < lcov.info\n\nThe `CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN` value is provided after you add your repo to your\nCode Climate account by clicking on \"Setup Test Coverage\" on the right hand side of your feed.\n\nPlease contact hello@codeclimate.com if you need any assistance setting this up.\n\n## Contributions\n\nPatches, bug fixes, feature requests, and pull requests are welcome on the\nGitHub page for this project: [https://github.com/codeclimate/javascript-test-reporter](https://github.com/codeclimate/ruby-test-reporter)\n\n## Copyright\n\nSee LICENSE.txt\n",
