Think of it as an opinionated `npm + browserify + rework-npm + grunt/gulp/broccoli` all wrapped into `component build`.\n\n  Want to know more about Component? Visit the [guide](https://github.com/componentjs/guide) or view the [comparison with other solutions](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/vs.md).\n\n  If you're confused about _component_, _components_, _componentjs_, please read [disambiguation](https://github.com/componentjs/component/blob/master/disambiguation.md)\n\n> **Component 1.0.0**: Several\nmajor new features have been added, some have been removed, and the project has been greatly reorganized. You may need to upgrade your\nversion of node and/or npm to avoid breakage. Please see the detailed [changelog](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/changelogs/1.0.0.md). Component 0.x will not be maintained anymore.\n\n## Installation\n\n  First, you need [node](http://nodejs.org) v0.10+ installed. If you do not have it installed, visit [node's download page](http://nodejs.org/download/).\n\n  With [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, run the following command:\n\n     $ npm install -g component\n\n## Getting Started\n\nRead this [Getting Started](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/getting-started.md) guide to get a basic static site running very quickly with Component.\n\nNote: the Component repo (this repo) has only documentation for Component 0.19. All of the documentation related to 1.0.0 will be handled in the [guide repo](https://github.com/componentjs/guide).\n\n## Team\n\nThe team and organization have undergone massive changes. In summary, [jonathanong](https://github.com/jonathanong) stopped developing Component and started with [normalize.io](https://normalize.github.io/) and the guys from [segmentio](https://github.com/segmentio) switched to using [duo](http://duojs.org). Component will still be maintained and updated while it is in use. You can read more about Duo.js and Component [here](https://github.com/componentjs/component/blob/master/Extra.md#about-duojs).\n\nThe long story of Component and the changes that occurred in component can be found in Jonathan Ong's blog post [\"the future of component\"](http://www.jongleberry.com/the-future-of-component.html).\n\nDevelopment for component (maintenance and features) will be continued at the latest when latest browsers will support the [ES6 modules](http://guybedford.com/es6-modules-today) and [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) natively.\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [Anton Wilhelm](https://github.com/timaschew)/[@timaschew](https://twitter.com/timaschew) - maintainer\n- [Keith Rosenberg](https://github.com/netpoetica)/[@netpoetica](https://twitter.com/netpoetica) - maintainer\n- [Trevor Gerhardt](https://github.com/trevorgerhardt)/[@trevorgerhardt](https://twitter.com/trevorgerhardt) - maintainer\n- [Clinton Wood](https://github.com/clintwood) - maintainer\n- [Jason Kurht](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt)/[@jasonkuhrt](https://twitter.com/jasonkuhrt) - maintainer\n- [visionmedia](https://github.com/visionmedia)/[@tjholowaychuk](https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk) - original author\n- [jonathanong](https://github.com/jonathanong)/[@jongleberry](https://twitter.com/jongleberry) - second-gen author\n- [segmentio](https://github.com/segmentio)/[segment.io](https://segment.io) - original sponsor\n",
