Start testing your code in seconds locally and move to cloud based browsers seamlessly for better coverage.\n\nDon't just claim your js supports \"all browsers\", prove it with tests!\n\n![zuul](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/71256/1669799/fb463296-5c81-11e3-818a-26776dc7a256.jpg)\n\n## Zuul workflow\n\nZuul works out of the box with a few commonly used javascript frameworks (qunit, mocha). If you are already testing using these, zuul setup will be trivial.\n\nZuul has 3 major ways in which it helps you test your code: locally, cloud browsers, and continuous integration. You should make sure that zuul is running for you locally before you try to run the other two.\n\nOnce you have [installed](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/installation) zuul proceed to the [quickstart](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/quickstart) to write your first test.\n\n### Running zuul locally\n\nWhen iterating on your tests during development, simply use zuul `--local` mode to see your tests run in a browser.\n\n![local zuul](https://raw.github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/gh-pages/develop-tests-locally.png)\n\nSee the [quickstart](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/quickstart) page on the wiki for more details.\n\n### Takeoff into the cloud\n\nThe reason we go through all this trouble in the first place is to seamlessly run our tests against all those browsers we don't have installed. Luckily, [saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) runs some browsers and we can easily task zuul to test on those.\n\n![testing in the cloud](https://raw.github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/gh-pages/double-check-with-sauce.png)\n\nSee the [cooking with sauce](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/cloud-testing) wiki page to get your tests running in the cloud.\n\n### Bring it home with travis-ci\n\nNo testing setup would be complete without a badge for passing or failing tests. After making sure your tests all pass in the cloud from your local machine, we will configure our tests to pass from travis-ci when we commit changes.\n\n![local zuul](https://raw.github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/gh-pages/finalize-with-travis.png)\n\nSee the [travis-ci integration](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/travis-ci) wiki page.\n\n## Examples\n\nSee the examples directory for some simple tests. Use the above knowledge to test the examples with your install of zuul.\n\n* [quickstart](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/tree/master/examples/quickstart) - from the [quickstart](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/Quickstart) wiki tutorial\n* [emberjs with qunit](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/tree/master/examples/ember_w_qunit) - basic ember.js app with qunit tests\n\nAll of the examples can be tested locally by running the following command in each example directory.\n\n```\nzuul --local 8080 -- test.js\n```\n\n## zuul.yml\n\nThe zuul consumes a yaml config file. See the [zuul.yml](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul/wiki/zuul.yml) wiki page for all of the goodies this file provides.\n\nIt includes advanced usage like how to run an additional server to support tests that make ajax requests.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\n\nThis probject is made possible by all the awesome modules it uses. See the `package.json` file for all the awesome.\n",
